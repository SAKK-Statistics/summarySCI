\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble containing the data to be summarized.}

\item{vars}{Continuous variables to include in the summary table. Default to
all variables present in the data except \code{group}.}

\item{group}{A single column from \code{data}.
Summary statistics will be stratified according to this variable.
Default to NULL. A maximum of 3 groups are currently supported.}

\item{stat_cont}{Summary statistic to display for continuous variables.
Options include "median_IQR", "median_range" (default), "mean_sd",
"mean_se" and "geomMean_sd".}

\item{visit}{Name of the stratum for which summary statistics are
displayed by line. Typically, this would be "visit".}

\item{order}{A numerical variable defining the visit order.}

\item{visitgroup}{A grouping variable for the stratum for which summary
statistics are displayed by line. Must be an ordered factor.
Typically, this would be a visit group such as e.g., baseline, follow-up etc.}

\item{digits_cont}{Digits for summary statistics and CI of continuous
variables. Default to 1.}

\item{add_n}{Logical. If a column with sample size (N) should be shown.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{overall}{Logical. If TRUE, an additional column with the total is
added to the table. Ignored, if no groups are defined. Default to FALSE.}

\item{as_flex_table}{Logical. If TRUE, the output is converted to a flex_table
object. Default is TRUE.}

\item{border}{Logical. If TRUE, a border will be drawn around the table. Only
available if flex_table = TRUE. Default is TRUE.}
